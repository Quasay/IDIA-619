        The main argument within this article is that  UX designers must learn and understand their product’s behavior. In order to do that, they must understand how the product’s mechanism is built (i.e Javascript if designing websites). Data, logic, and network connections are the building blocks of any digital product. The article states that if you do not know how to use these building blocks, you end up being like a makeup artist who can only make a face prettier but not highlight it’s characteristics.

        Another argument that the article makes is that you need to be working closely with your development team. If you do not understand the technicalities of implementing your design that it is hard for you to participate in decision-making processes. Simply using the right terminology will greatly improve the collaboration between you and the development team.

        Lastly, knowing how to code allows designers to rapidly prototype their designs with functionality. For example, writing a script/stylesheet will allow UX Designers to quickly test and interact with their designs within a web browser. Coding will surely help with the process of rapidly testing and reiterating over designs, thus saving time and resources from the team.

        A quote from the article I really liked:

        <i>“In the IT industry, which as a UX designer you’re a part of, not knowing code means not only not knowing the programming language, but also not knowing the “spoken” language.” </i>
